Due to the large number of features and the complexity of the data, manual analysis is not feasible. Your goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the sale price of houses based on various features such as lot size, house style, and condition. You will need to preprocess the data, engineer new features, select the best model, and evaluate its performance. By successfully completing this task, you will contribute to the company's ability to make accurate predictions and improve their decision-making process.
