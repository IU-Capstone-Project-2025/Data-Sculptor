summary: Upload a Jupyter profile notebook
description: |
  Accepts an **.ipynb** file that follows a predefined structure and
  stores its content into the database. The notebook must contain:

  1. A *first* markdown cell with the overall task description.
  2. Subsequent **pairs** of *markdown* + *code* cells representing
     independent sections.

  The service extracts the description and sections and persists them
  into two tables: `profiles` and `profile_sections`.
